              <p class="card-text">This is the first question you might want to ask before installing a cybersecurity solution in your organization. Well, the three main uses of cybersecurity are to protect your data and networks, ensure network security by preventing unauthorized access to network resources, and improve the recovery time after any successful breach.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The 5Cs of cybersecurity are the five main areas of cybersecurity that are important for enterprises or organizations. The five Cs of cybersecurity includes compliance, cost, coverage, continuity, and change. Organizations adopting cybersecurity measures target cost, compliance, business continuity (or simply continuity), and change (or adapting to new changes, industrial or market). Comprehensive coverage involves implementing various security solutions to protect against cyber threats.</p>

              <p class="card-text">One of the main studied concepts in cybersecurity is cryptography. Cryptography is the study of systems and techniques for securing information from unauthorized access. Cryptography teaches the best practices, techniques and processes for protecting information from unauthorized users and malicious software.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">4. What’s the CIA triad in cybersecurity?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The CIA triad is a common concept in cybersecurity that refers to confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of information. In cybersecurity, confidentiality refers to the sensitivity of information and how to protect sensitive data from unauthorized third parties. Integrity refers to the quality of data being of its original context and nature and without being modified by unauthorized third parties or partners.

Accessibility refers to how accessible or reachable information is to the people it serves. In protecting information from unauthorized access, this information can have a set of complexity such that it’s inaccessible to its end users. So, reconciling data safety and its use, accessibility becomes of critical importance.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">5. What’s the difference between encryption and hashing?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Although encryption and hashing both serve the same purpose of converting readable information or data into unreadable data, the two share distinct differences or variations. Encrypted data can be converted back to readable text through a process known as decryption. On the other hand, hashed text or data cannot be converted back to readable text or data. Protecting data through these methods is crucial in preventing identity theft, which can result from data breaches and other cybersecurity attacks.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">What’s the cost of deploying cybersecurity to protect sensitive data in my enterprise?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">This is perhaps one of the most frequently asked questions about cybersecurity. Cybersecurity cost differs from organization to organization and from infrastructure to infrastructure. Businesses spend between 4% to 10% of their annual budget on cybersecurity. Having a managed service provider who can scale your cybersecurity services depending on changing business needs is most preferable, because you’ll enjoy the value for money and the economies of scale. Additionally, implementing security awareness training can significantly reduce cybersecurity costs by helping employees recognize and avoid potential threats, thereby minimizing the risk of costly breaches.</p>
